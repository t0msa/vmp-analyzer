# vmp-analyzer

### Usage

    vmp-analyzer.exe <file> <option>

### Options

    -xrefs: Lists all xrefs to all VM Entries.
    -entries: Lists addresses of VM Entries.

### Motivation

I decided to make this tool when I wanted to dump all possible VM Entries. It has worked for all VMProtect 3.5.0 binaries I've tested, you have to try other versions yourself. I don't think it'll work with VMProtect 2 binaries.
